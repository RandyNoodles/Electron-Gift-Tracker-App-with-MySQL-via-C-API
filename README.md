# Overview
This is an app for those of us who dread the pressures of gift-giving! 

It was originally a school project with the restriction: **database operations _must_ be done in C**, leading to the non-standard configuration found here.

Having built _more than enough_ C console-based UIs thus far in my education, I took the initiative to explore other UI options and discovered Electron.js.
Electron allowed me to build a more modern & intuitive UI for the app, while meeting requirements by developing a C application to perform database CRUD operations as a child process.

Having since learned some more advanced CSS, as well as React, I think the frontend needs a bit of a facelift. But at the time, I was pretty proud of the result!
