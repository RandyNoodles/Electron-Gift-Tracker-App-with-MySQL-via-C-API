This is our C app.
It's just a normal C console app, and you can open it via Visual Studio.

It takes in a bunch of command line args. Argv[1] is always an integer representing
the command to execute.
It takes that integer and just goes through a giant switch statement of "What function do I call".


Then it either uses printf("result") to print good results to stdout.
or fprintf(stderr, "error") to print errors to stderr.

Electron detects which stream was written to, along with the exit code, and passes back:
Success: <true OR false>
Output: <stdout  OR  stderr, depending on success's value>
